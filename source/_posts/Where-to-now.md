So I gave notice that in two weeks I would resign from my position at Rackspace two weeks ago.  I think it useful at this stage to provide what motivated me, and where I plan to go now that the smoke has cleared.  First for the shock and horror, I didn't secure a job for myself prior to leaving.  What I want to do with my time doesn't necessitate the immediate procurement of employment, in fact what I plan to use my time for will need profound focus and for me courage to do that I don't think I would be able to complete successfully if I had a job while going through it.  I've found my calling and I don't want to do anything other than focus on mastering its skill set.   That is I want to be a data scientist.  

Like many when I was little I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up.  To be honest I didn't even have a notion of what it would, or could mean.  Now at 36 I finally do.  If I had known at 16 I would have been advanced, at 26 I would have been on time, but move ahead one decade and I find myself fully embracing what I want, even if it's come later to me than most.  As I know what makes me tick, as I am already a technologist with a reasonably strong analytical mathematical background, as I have some savings I'm not worrying about having a job.  I'm moving forward towards this singular goal by self study and if I find that not to be enough then with the help of a boot camp, [Zipfian](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/) .  

One criticism to my strategy is that there are multiple ways of approaching any goal, some more reasonable than others.  One such strategy is to procure a job prior in a similar field to the one I ultimately would like to play a part in.  For instance I could have attempted to get a job as a data analyst but I know Python better than I know Excel, I have more knowledge of and practical control of algorithms than I would ever have a chance to use if I was to work in this capacity.  And the question might be at this point, so what?  So because I don't need to work right now at things I don't want to, and I have plenty of work to do in an area I do, even if it's not currently monetarily incentivized I'm going to hold off on taking a job I won't be happy with and work on a longer term goal.

It's a risk but one I've decided to take. ( For now -  Mon Jun  1 22:27:57 CDT 2015 - I'll end this post for the time being but I plan to expand upon it in the days that follow ).
